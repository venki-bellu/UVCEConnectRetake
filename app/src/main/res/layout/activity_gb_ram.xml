            android:text="\n \nHaving immense interest in the field of music, Suhas (violonist) was curious to know if there was an existing music band in UVCE. It  was then when he got introduced to Raghavendra who is the vocalist and plays the acoustic guitar. They did have similar interest in Indian classical and carnatic music. They spoke to each other to find out about other such existing talents in the same place. It was then when Sanjay and Sanjit both who play the Keyboard also joined in and started our musical journey.
Thats how 8GB RAM was started. Namma UVCEs proud band.
\nName sounds unique right, here's the story behind it. It was a time to name the band such that it gets recognized by the outside world. Team came up with many names and ideas but everything wasn't very convincing. It was then thought that the band needed to be named uniquely and usually no band name
starts with a number, so we came up with 8 GB RAM.
\n8GB RAM now is a team of 9 members which is well known among the different bands in Bangalore. They have won numerous awards in the fests happening in and around Bangalore                        "
